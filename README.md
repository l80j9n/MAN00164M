Introduction to the   Dissertation   (Applied)
Welcome to the   Dissertation   in   Management Studies – Applied   (MAN00164M)
As   part   of   the   successful   completion   of   their   study   on   the   Master's   degree   programmes,   all   candidates   mustcomplete   either:   A)   a   traditional   scholarly   dissertation   in   management   studies;   or   B)   an   applied   dissertation   related   to   a   core   topic   within   their   programme   of   study.      This   module   is   designed   for   those   who   have   chosen   option   B, the applied project. You   must   pass this   module to   pass your   programme.This    Postgraduate   Taught    (Masters)    Dissertation    in    Management    Studies      (Applied)    module    is    a    student-led   module   conducted through   an   independently   researched   and written   dissertation.    The   assumption   is that   you   have   passed all your   required   modules to date   and   so   have the   level   of   skill   and   knowledge to   decide   upon   and   execute an appropriate   piece of applied   research.    You   DO   NOT   receive   one-on-one   supervision   in   this   module.   However, your study is supported through the content provided in this module (through a combination of online   material   and   face   to   face   workshops)   in   addition   to   drop-in   sessions   during   the   summer   semester   (S3).      Your   module   concludes   with   the   delivery   of   an   8,000-word   consultant-style   report   inclusive   of   a   reflective   diary. As   part   of   the   assessment,   you   will   also   submit   a   recorded   poster   presentation   of   your   progress   on   your   chosen   project.It should   be   evident that the   Dissertation   in   Management Studies   (Applied)   is a   core   and   important   component   of   your Master's programme.    While the   module brings together students from across several of our programme,   each   student’s   dissertation   must   focus   on   an   area   directly   relevant   to   their   chosen   master’s   programme.   The   table below provides a general view of the focus area of your dissertation vis-à-vis your chosen   programme.    So,   for example, if you are on the   MSc   International   Business then the focus of your dissertation   must   be directly on   the core topics and   literature   in the topic of   international   business.

The   Module comprises 60 credits,   representing almost   one-third of the   total   master’sdegree.This   module   is   designed   to   provide   you   with   the   opportunity   to   showcase   the   summation   of   your   learning   throughout    the    year.    You      will      focus      on      the      development      of      professional      skills      and      attributes       based    on   individually based research by demonstrating and showcasing your mastery of   the program knowledge and skills   by   using   the   frameworks   and   theories   that   you   have   learned   in   the   core   and/or   elective   modules   within   your   Master's   programme.    This will allow you to demonstrate the   development   of transferable   skills   by   using   critical   and analytical skills to develop actionable   managerial   recommendations   by   carrying   out   research   into your   area   of study. The final   part   of the   project   requires you   to   foster   reflexive   practice   and   self-awareness   vital   for   your   development as a   professional   practitioner   in the   business environment.

Major Assignment   (Worth 90%)
The   two   parts   areas   follows:
●             Part ~1: Individual Strategic Consulting Report. This part consists of a 7,500-word strategic consulting report   in   response to your chosen   project.
o    You   are   expected to   research your   project   extensively;   do   not   over-rely   on   a   single source;   and   you   should   go   above   and   beyond   the   material   that   you   have   submitted   for   other   modules   (self-plagiarism rules apply in the same way as other   forms   of   plagiarism)   .   Do   not   reuse   or   re-   hash   previous assignments for your dissertation.
●             Part   ~2:   Self-Reflection.   The   final   part   is   comprised   of   500   words   which   will   feature   as   the   final   chapter   in   your   dissertation.   This   final   part   of   the   report   is   a   personal   reflection   (more   about   the   self-reflection   and   structure of   the dissertation will be explained fully during the formal workshops for the   module).    While your   report   might   vary   in   general   structure   compared   to   other   students   in   your   cohort,   the   self-reflection   is   mandatory so all students will   include their   self-reflection   as   a final   section   in   their   report.
Detailed   advice   as   well   as   a   workshop   on   self-reflection   will   be   provided   within   the   module.      In   addition   to   more   resources and advice   on VLE.
A Self-Directed   Project
What is expected   of youA   self-directed   project   is   demanding   and   will   require   you   to   be   motivated,   proactive   and   engaged   with   your   dissertation.   Self-director   means   you   will   NOT   receive   one   on   one   supervision   as   you   would   in   the   academic   dissertation.   This   module   provides   you   with   everything   you   need   to   start,   manage   and   submit   your   major   and   minor   assignments.   In   fact,   this   handbook,   along   with   the   VLE   site   contains   everything   you   need   to   get   your   dissertation done.    The   lectures and workshops will   enhance   and   extend   all the   information   available.There area   lot of excellent   resources that will   be   provided to   you   on   VLE   under your   module   site,   in   addition   to   the   mandatory   seminars   and workshops.      It   is   an   expectation that you will   engage   heavily   with the   information   provided, and you complete all tasks and   assignments   recommended   as   part   of yourself-directed   learning.The   major   benefits of this are that you are   in   control   of your time,   and there   is   great   flexibility   in   terms   of   when   you   choose to   engage with the course   material   and   to   a certain   extent,   complete   tasks.   However,   this   freedom   also   comes   with   a   challenge: you   must   ensure   you   stay on   top   of the   course   content   and   self-directed   reading   and tasks, and complete this on   time   for   submission.Always remember,   noon代 写MAN00164M Dissertation in Management Studies 2023-2024Matlab

That   responsibility is to enact what your learn,   apply   it,   and   use   it to   reinforce your   knowledge   where   appropriate   and   adapt   and   change   where   new   knowledge   is   gained.    The   main   assumptions   are that:
●          You   have thoroughly   read   and engaged with this   module   handbook   which   contains   significant   amounts   of information.
●          You engage fully   with   the   module   VLE   site   by:
o   Watching the   mini-lectures and “how to” videos.
o   Reading the allotted   readings for each   session.
o   Engaging   in any tasks or exercises   requested of you.      Including   the   online   discussions   fora
o   Approaching your   study with a sense of fun,   curiosity   and   eagerness.
o   Try to   learn at   least one thing   new during   each   lesson,   reading,   or video.
o   Reflecting on your learning and its impact on your   journey towards becoming a qualified masters   in your topic   area.
o   Completing   all   assignment   tasks   to   the   best   of   your   ability   and   capability.

This means you read the readings, you did the tasks, you   identified   where your weaknesses were and sought   to   address   them.
The   Dissertation: what, why and   how?The   Dissertation   in   Management   Studies   (Applied)   Module   is   integral   to   your   Master’s   Degree   Course.      Unlike   the   scholarly   traditional   style   of   a   dissertation,   the   applied   dissertation   follows   a   specific   formula   and   so   does   not   vary   in   structure   as   much   as   a   traditional   dissertation.       For   example,   the   methods   of   data   collection   are   standard   for   all   students   in   the   applied   module.      All   students   will   need   to   identify   and   collect   secondary   data   appropriate to their   question/problem.   Hence the   methods taught   in   this   module   are   aimed   at   secondary   data   collection,   how   it   is   used,    how    it   can    be   analysed   and    how   to   write    up   and    present    secondary-data-driven   research.   You will   be required to demonstrate competence in secondary   data   gathering,   analysis,   and   write-up.   Eventhough   secondary   data   is   a   specific   kind   of   data,   you   will   still   need   to   understand   the   nature   and   role   of   secondary   data within the   broader   area   of the   philosophy   of social   science,   and   its ontology   and   epistemology.   Put simply, secondary data can still be   pursued through positivism or interpretivism philosophy for example,   and   secondary data can   be analysed   inductively or   deductively,   and   it   can   also   be   qualitative   or   quantitative.So,   you   do    need   to    be   mindful   and   appreciate   that   there   is   still   a   core   element   of   understanding    research   methods   in this   module. The   only difference   is that there   are stricter   boundaries to the   methods you   are   using,   and   you   are   all   essentially   using   the   same   method.      You   must   be   careful   not   to   choose   a   research   question   or   problem       not       answerable       through       secondary       data.                Similarly,       you       should         not         make       conclusions         and   recommendations   based on secondary data that does   not   allow   you   to   make   such   conclusions.
The   Process:   how you will do your dissertationThe   best   way   to   think   about   the   dissertation   is   as   nothing   more   or   less   than   a   project.      Doing   so   allows   you   to   demystify the   process   and focuses your   attention   onto the fact   that   a   dissertation   is   a   deliverable   product   that   has   a   beginning,   middle   and   an   end.      In   other words,   it’s   doable,   it’s   been   done   before,   and you, too,   can   do   it.   There   is   nothing   magical   about   a   dissertation,   and   as   long   as you trust   in the   process,   and   do   what   is   required,   you will complete and submit your dissertation   just   like   many thousands of people   studying   around the   UK   have   done over the   year.
The   module will   add to   and   build   upon   students’   learning   throughout their   programme   of study   to   allow them   to   produce a consulting   report-style. dissertation.      For the dissertation,   you   will:
●          Focus   in on   and   identify   a   specific   problem   or   opportunity   within   a topic   relevant   to your   programme   of   study
●          Identify    and    self-select   an   organisation   facing   a   managerial   or   strategic/international   strategic   issues   within your chosen topic
●          Clearly   identify the   industry that   your   organization   is   part   of   (it   is   recommended   you   use   an   industry   of   which you are familiar, and which has sufficient data available to   use   in your dissertation,).   If you   choose   an   industry   you   have   not   worked   in,   it   is   highly   recommended   that   you   choose   an   industry   that   you   intend to or wish to   work   in the   near   future.
●          Draw   upon your   previous   modules to   identify   a   scholarly   theory   or   model   that   will   be   applied   as   a   lens   to   the   organization   and   its   problems   (you   need   to   show   you   know   how   to   apply   what   you   learned   to   the   right context and   level   of   analysis)
●          Locate,    become    acquainted   with    and   critically   review   the   scholarly   literature   in   your   problem   area.   Conduct a   literature   review to   help frame. their analysis and substantiate   their   recommendations
●          Collect secondary data about this   organisation from   multiple   data   sources,   including   existing   databases,   if    relevant,    and    use      frameworks      appropriate      to      their      programme      of      study      (e.g.      IB,      Management,   Strategy)   to   analyse   the   issue   and   provide   recommendations   for   action.       Included   here   is   a   secondary   data analysis of the   industry, the organization and the   problem   (topic/issue)
●          Analyse the data collected   and   discuss the   results   of the   analyses   to   reach   to   make   recommendations.
●          (for   the   reflective   chapter)   Demonstrate   a   reflexive   understanding   of   their   strengths   and   weaknesses   based   on   experience   of   developing   an   individual   research   project   over   an   extended   period,   as   well   as   consider the contribution of the dissertation and   their   programme   of   study   to their   own   practice.
The   Product: what your dissertation should   look like
As you   have chosen the applied   module   it   is   important that you   do   not   compare   what you   are   doing   and   how   you are doing   it to your colleagues   in the   academic   dissertation.    An   applied   dissertation   such   as   this   one   will
vary far   less across students within this   module compared to   those   doing   a   traditional   dissertation   (where
different   methods, different types of analysis, and   much   longer   literature   reviews   will   be   used).      Even   so,   in   the   applied   mode, you do   have some freedom to tailor the   structure to your   own   particular   style.   For   example,
some of your sub-headings, the focal organization, and   how   you   analyse   and   present   your   data   may   vary   to
other students   in your cohort.          As   long as you   cover   the   ‘mandatory’   chapters   and   sections,   you   are   free   to               vary other aspects without   requiring   permission or the   ok from your   professor.      However,   if you   do   wish   to   be   more creative and detour significantly from the   mandatory   requirements   please   check   with   your   professor
before you do so –   breaching the expected   structure   can   impact   on your final   mark.      It’s   safest   to   adhere   to   or   not vary far from the suggested structure   here.
The Mandatory Chapter and Sections
The   below   information will   signal to you what the dissertation ‘should’ contain   (indicated   by   the   word
Mandatory   in   bold text) –   mandatory   means this section   MUST   be   in the dissertation.      However, this does   not   mean you cannot vary or add   parts to your   dissertation   not   covered   here.      You   are   free   to   vary   what   sections         are contained within the   mandatory   parts, and   how these are   structured.You can   use this table as a   checklist   once you   have   completed your   dissertation   to   ensure   you   have   covered   the   relevant   items, and adhere to the   length constraints etc.         (N/A)   denotes   this   section   is   not   included   in   the   word   count.
